Project Description –

**Online Book Store (SQL)**

This project is an **SQL-based Online Book Store database** designed to simulate a real-world bookstore management system. It is built using three core relational tables: 

* **Customers** – stores customer information.
* **Books** – contains details of books available in the store.
* **Orders** – manages purchase records and order tracking.

* The project demonstrates both **basic and advanced SQL operations** through:
* **12 Basic Queries** – covering data retrieval, filtering, sorting, and aggregation using clauses like WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, and DISTINCT.

* **8 Advanced Queries** – implementing more complex operations such as INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, along aggregate functions to provide deeper insights and relationships across tables. Key Features:

* Data organization into normalized relational tables.

* Use of **aggregate functions** (COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc.) for business insights.
* Application of **joins** to link customer purchases with books and order details.
* Demonstration of SQL clauses for structured reporting and decision-making. This project serves as a hands-on demonstration of **database design, query writing, and relational data handling** in SQL, making it an excellent learning resource for beginners while also showcasing intermediate-level query optimization and reporting techniques.
